	<h4>Research shows that plasma donation is safe, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) emphasize that there is no risk of getting the wrong blood back. Also, the FDA and other health authorities regulate the equipment and procedure of plasma donation.</h4><p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
